			<p style="text-align:left"><b><i>Death of a Starling</i></b>, the second novel in Linda Norlander’s delightful A Cabin by the Lake mystery series, offers something compelling for every reader. If you’re partial to sense of place, Starling delivers a wonderful evocation of Minnesota’s great Northwoods. Interesting characters, some quirky, some very dark, jump from the pages of every chapter. There’s a bit of romance, a lot of suspense, some fine inclusion of elements of the Ojibwe culture, and a wonderfully serpentine plot that’s sure to keep you guessing to the end. I can’t think of a better read at a summer cabin or in front of roaring winter fire. -<b>William Kent Krueger</b>, author of the New York Times bestseller <i>This Tender Land</>

DEATH OF A STARLING is filled with small town intrigues that will remind readers of Twin Peaks and the familiar terrain of northern Minnesota seen in William Kent Kreuger’s Cork O’Connor Series.
